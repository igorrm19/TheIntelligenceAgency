## Operation Digital Rolodex

Welcome, Agent. The intelligence agency is undergoing a mandatory digital transformation. 
Currently, we store our list of active field agents on sticky notes, which... 
represents a security risk. To address this, we created this sophisticated 
back-end software for storing data in JSON files.
